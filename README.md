# simple-log
A simple, web-based log utility that is very easy to start using, but also flexible enough to meet each users exact needs.

###Inspiration####
I'll admit it: I love lists and I love goals.  While they might not work for everyone, they are a really great motivational tool for me.  What I really dislike is coming up with a new goal, but then having to find a way to track it.  It takes time to create something, and if you want to find something, the odds of it meeting your exact needs are slim to none.  So I really wanted to create a simple utility that would be easy to set up, but would also be flexible enough to do exactly what I need it to.

Imagine if I could have one utility that I could track my bike mileage, and use as a reading log? A utility that would have a common interface, but allow me to easily create different logs to meet my needs, each tracking different attributes that I decide on?

Well, that is what I am hoping Simple-Log ends up being.

###Also...###
While I love the idea, and I think it will be useful, this is also a perfect test project for me to begin using PHP (or find a technology that meets my needs better?) and get something to show.

###Long term...###
There are several features I would like to see added (at some point):

- Reporting (probably by time, but flexible enough to use the custom attributes)
- Goals (I would love to be able to set up custom goals on a log)
- Log Template (something that one person can build, but then other users can start using?)
